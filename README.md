# HistoryGuardian

A multi purpose history helper script to have bash history per project.

This program is inspired by an article wrote by Tristan Colombo for a French magazine called "Linux Magazine France" and then, in another issue of the same magazine, a rewrote version by Alban Mancheron was presented.
I retained the initial concept; however, I modified it for my personal purposes and rewrote it in accordance with my preferences.
You can find the original and reworked versions here https://github.com/tcolombo/history-guardian and there https://gite.lirmm.fr/doccy/history-guardian/
